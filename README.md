# PasswordGenerator

## Description

This is a randomized password generator. Having this tool in my toolbox as a piece of code that I can use by adding it in to future projects is a miniature project I am happy to have spent time working through.

The greatest challenge in this project was generating the alert if the password size was not within the correct range and in specifying each type of character to be used.


## Credits

 I primarily worked on this alone, however I worked with Travis Umbel, Keely York, Megan Schneider and Cameron Kirk doing the pseudo code. I relied heavily on Google for information. Starter Code provided by Xandromas.
